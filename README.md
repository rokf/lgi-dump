A bunch of tiny `Lua LGI` examples. Made this because I constantly forget how to do certain stuff.
As the official `lgi` repository at [pavouk/lgi](https://github.com/pavouk/lgi) doesn't contain
everything I'd wish for I've chosen to make my own little collection to complement that one.
Each example from the `examples` folder has its matching screenshot in the `screenshots` folder.
